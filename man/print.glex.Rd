\description{
This is implemented mainly to avoid flooding the console in cases where the \code{glex} object
uses many terms, which leads to a large amount of column names of \verb{$m} being printed to the console.
This function wraps \code{\link[utils:str]{str()}} with a truncated output for a more compact representation.
